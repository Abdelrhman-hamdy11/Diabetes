# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning


## 📌 Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. Using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, we explore data preprocessing, feature analysis, and classification modeling to build an accurate diabetes prediction system.

## 📊 Dataset


- **Features:**
  - `Pregnancies`: Number of times pregnant
  - `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration
  - `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
  - `SkinThickness`: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
  - `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
  - `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
  - `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
  - `Age`: Age in years
  - `Outcome`: Binary (0: Non-diabetic, 1: Diabetic)

## ⚙️ Steps in the Notebook

- ✅ Data cleaning and handling missing values
- 📈 Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- 🔍 Feature selection and scaling
- 🤖 Model training with Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree
- 🧪 Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- 🔮 **Custom Prediction Function:** A function was created to input a patient's data (e.g., age, glucose level, BMI, etc.) and predict if the patient is diabetic or not based on the trained model.
